      "D": "Binary System Output Dump for low-level data logging"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "BSOD stands for Blue Screen of Death, also known as a stop error. It is a critical system error screen displayed by Windows when it encounters a fatal error from which it cannot recover. It typically includes a stop code that helps identify the cause of the crash.",

      "D": "Run a full antivirus scan to check for malware causing system instability"
    },
    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "The DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL stop code typically indicates a driver issue. Since the BSOD started after installing a new graphics card, the most likely cause is a driver conflict. Booting into Safe Mode and rolling back or updating the driver is the correct first step. Reinstalling Windows is excessive, motherboard replacement is unrelated, and an antivirus scan would not address a driver issue.",

      "D": "A fragmented hard drive with heavily scattered file allocation tables reducing read performance"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Constant 100% disk utilization is a hallmark sign of degraded performance caused by either a failing hard drive (indicated by slow read/write speeds) or excessive background services and processes consuming disk I/O.

    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Frequent unexpected shutdowns during resource-intensive tasks strongly suggest overheating.

      "A": "A low memory warning means the system is running out of RAM or virtual memory, while a USB controller warning means the host controller has exhausted its available endpoints or bandwidth",
      "B": "Both warnings indicate the same issue with insufficient system RAM allocation and should be resolved by adding more physical memory modules to the motherboard",
      "C": "A low memory warning is about available storage space on the disk, while a USB controller warning is about physical RAM capacity and module configuration",
      "D": "A USB controller resource warning always requires a motherboard replacement to add more USB headers, while a low memory warning requires adding more RAM sticks"
    },
    "correct": "A",
    "explanation": "A low memory warning means the system is running out of available RAM and virtual memory, often caused by too many applications running simultaneously. A USB controller resource warning means the USB host controller has exhausted its available endpoints or bandwidth, typically caused by connecting too many USB devices, especially through hubs.

    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Time drift, especially when the system is powered off, is a classic symptom of a failing CMOS/RTC (Real-Time Clock) battery on the motherboard. This battery maintains the system clock when the computer is off. While internet time sync temporarily corrects it, the clock drifts again because the failing battery cannot maintain the time.

    "options": {
      "A": "Both issues are caused by RAM failure resulting in memory read/write errors during the boot process that prevent the operating system from loading",
      "B": "Computer A likely has a corrupted boot record or missing partition, while Computer B likely has a driver or system file issue occurring after the boot loader starts",

      "D": "Computer A has a software issue related to missing application files, while Computer B has a hardware issue exclusively involving physical component failure"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "'No OS found' indicates the system cannot locate a bootable partition or the boot record is corrupted/missing, meaning the OS boot process never begins. A BSOD that occurs after the Windows logo appears means the boot loader successfully started but the OS encountered a critical error during loading, such as a corrupt driver or system file.

      "D": "The Sunday full backup plus only the Wednesday incremental backup for the restore operation"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "With an incremental backup strategy, restoration requires the last full backup plus every incremental backup taken since that full backup, in order. To restore to the state before the Thursday crash, you need the Sunday full backup and then apply the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday incremental backups in sequence. This is why incremental backups are faster to create but slower to restore.",

    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Proper lifting technique requires bending at the knees (not the waist), keeping the back straight, and using leg muscles to lift.

    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "When handling customer personal information (PII), data privacy and security are the primary considerations. A public AI service processes data on external servers, potentially storing or using it in ways that violate privacy regulations like GDPR or HIPAA. A private AI deployment keeps data within the organization's infrastructure and control. Organizations handling regulated data must evaluate whether external AI services comply with applicable privacy laws and industry regulations.",
