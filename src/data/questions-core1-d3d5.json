    "explanation": "IPS (In-Plane Switching) panels offer the widest viewing angles among LCD types, typically 178 degrees both horizontally and vertically.

It is primarily used in servers and workstations where data integrity is critical. DDR5 is a generation of RAM, not an error-correction feature. SODIMM is a form factor.

    "explanation": "To enable dual-channel mode, matching RAM modules must be installed in the same-colored DIMM slots, which correspond to the same memory channel.

    "explanation": "Liquid cooling provides more efficient heat dissipation than air cooling because liquid transfers heat more effectively than air, and it generally operates more quietly under heavy loads since the radiator fans can spin at lower speeds.

When this battery dies, the system clock resets and BIOS settings may be lost each time the computer is shut down. Replacing the CMOS battery resolves the issue.

    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "The most common cause of 'No Signal' on a projector is an incorrect input source selection or a loose cable. The technician should first verify the projector is set to the HDMI input and that the cable is securely connected at both ends. The laptop display working fine confirms the GPU is functional. Replacing the bulb, reinstalling the OS, or replacing the motherboard are unnecessary and premature steps.",

    "explanation": "Burn-in occurs when a static image is displayed for an extended period, causing the pixels in that area to degrade unevenly and leave a permanent ghost image visible on the screen.

    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Incorrect color display can be caused by improper color temperature settings in the monitor's OSD (On-Screen Display), a loose or damaged video cable (especially analog VGA connections where a loose pin can drop a color channel), or incorrect driver color profiles.

Common causes include blocked air vents (placed too close to a wall or surface), a clogged dust filter, a failing internal fan, or high ambient temperatures.

      "D": "The monitor is not functioning"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Limited connectivity with local access but no internet typically indicates a DHCP issue (the device may have an APIPA address in the 169.254.x.x range), an incorrect default gateway, or misconfigured DNS settings. If the user can ping local devices, the physical connection is working (ruling out a disconnected cable or failed NIC). Monitor function is unrelated to network connectivity.",

    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "High latency means there is a significant delay between when data is sent and when a response is received (measured in milliseconds). This causes slow-loading websites, delayed file transfers, and poor real-time communication quality. Common causes include network congestion, long physical distances, multiple router hops, and overloaded network devices. High latency is not a sign of good performance or excessive bandwidth.",

    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "When slow speeds are isolated to users on a specific switch, the issue likely lies with that switch. The technician should check for auto-negotiation issues (ports running at 10/100 Mbps instead of 1 Gbps), duplex mismatches (half vs full duplex), a failing switch backplane, or a degraded uplink cable connecting the switch to the core network.

The DNS server may be down, the user's DNS settings may be misconfigured, or the DNS cache may be corrupted. The technician should verify DNS settings (ipconfig /all), try alternate DNS servers, and flush the DNS cache (ipconfig /flushdns). The NIC and cable are working since IP access works.

    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Consistent vertical lines on every page from a laser printer typically indicate a scratch or defect on the imaging drum, or a dirty/damaged wiper blade that is not properly cleaning the drum surface.
