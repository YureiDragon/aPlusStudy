      "D": "The new display panel is emitting electromagnetic interference affecting wireless signal"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Wi-Fi antenna wires typically run through the display bezel in laptops. When the display is replaced, these wires can be disconnected, pinched, or damaged, leading to significantly weaker signal. The wireless card itself is unlikely to be damaged if the display was the focus. BIOS updates and display interference are not related to Wi-Fi signal degradation after a display replacement.",

    "explanation": "Since external USB headsets work correctly, the sound card and audio drivers are functioning.

      "D": "It reduces power consumption more effectively than software-based camera controls"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "A physical privacy shutter provides a hardware-level guarantee that the camera lens is physically blocked, so no image can be captured regardless of software or malware activity. Software-based controls can potentially be bypassed by malware. The shutter does not improve image quality, does not specifically prevent driver manipulation, and power savings are negligible.",

    "explanation": "The technician should consult the service manual for proper antenna wire placement. The two antenna leads (often labeled MAIN and AUX) must be connected to the correct terminals for optimal wireless performance.

When this battery dies, the system clock resets and BIOS settings may be lost each time the computer is shut down. Replacing the CMOS battery resolves the issue.

    "explanation": "Intermittent projector shutdowns with temperature warnings indicate the projector is overheating. Common causes include blocked air vents (placed too close to a wall or surface), a clogged dust filter, a failing internal fan, or high ambient temperatures. The technician should clean the filter, ensure proper ventilation, and check the fan. File size, HDMI cables, and room brightness do not cause thermal shutdowns.",

    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "A swollen lithium-ion battery is a serious safety hazard as it can rupture, catch fire, or explode. The swelling is caused by internal chemical decomposition producing gas. The device should be powered off, the battery carefully removed (if possible), and it must be disposed of at an authorized battery recycling center -- never in regular trash.

Paper type causes quality issues, not garbled text. Toner brand does not affect text rendering. Physical distance (within cable specs) does not cause garbled output.",

The technician should clean or replace pickup rollers, inspect the paper path for torn paper fragments, and verify paper guides are properly adjusted. Fuser temperature settings affect print quality, not paper feeding. Toner cartridge issues cause image defects, not jams.

    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "AI systems can hallucinate, generating commands or instructions that appear correct but are fabricated or potentially harmful. Before running any unfamiliar AI-generated command on a production system, the technician should verify it through official documentation, knowledge base articles, or trusted sources. This is especially critical because a wrong command could cause data loss, system crashes, or security vulnerabilities.",

      "A": "Accuracy and bias are the same limitation and do not need to be distinguished when evaluating AI model performance or output quality",

    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Accuracy limitations mean AI can generate factually wrong information across any topic, producing hallucinations that sound plausible but are incorrect. Bias limitations mean AI can systematically favor or disadvantage certain groups, perspectives, or outcomes based on imbalances in training data. Accuracy is about the correctness of individual outputs, while bias is about systematic unfairness across outputs. Both require awareness and mitigation strategies.",

    "explanation": "When handling customer personal information (PII), data privacy and security are the primary considerations. A public AI service processes data on external servers, potentially storing or using it in ways that violate privacy regulations like GDPR or HIPAA. A private AI deployment keeps data within the organization's infrastructure and control. Organizations handling regulated data must evaluate whether external AI services comply with applicable privacy laws and industry regulations.",
