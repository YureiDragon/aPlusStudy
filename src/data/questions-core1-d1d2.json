    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "The first step before any internal laptop repair is to disconnect the battery. This prevents electrical shock and protects the components from short circuits. Removing screws, opening the case, and handling cables all come after the battery has been safely disconnected.",

      "D": "The new display is emitting interference"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Wi-Fi antenna wires typically run through the display bezel in laptops. When the display is replaced, these wires can be disconnected, pinched, or damaged, leading to significantly weaker signal. The wireless card itself is unlikely to be damaged if the display was the focus. BIOS updates and display interference are not related to Wi-Fi signal degradation after a display replacement.",

      "D": "It reduces power consumption more effectively than software controls"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "A physical privacy shutter provides a hardware-level guarantee that the camera lens is physically blocked, so no image can be captured regardless of software or malware activity. Software-based controls can potentially be bypassed by malware. The shutter does not improve image quality, does not specifically prevent driver manipulation, and power savings are negligible.",

      "D": "Connect only the white wire, as the black wire is for NFC"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "The technician should consult the service manual for proper antenna wire placement. The two antenna leads (often labeled MAIN and AUX) must be connected to the correct terminals for optimal wireless performance.

The tone generator is connected to one end of the cable and emits a signal, while the probe detects the signal at the other end or along the cable path. A crimper attaches connectors.

    "explanation": "A cable tester verifies the physical integrity of a network cable by checking for proper pin-to-pin wiring (T568A/T568B), continuity (all conductors connected end to end), and detecting faults like shorts (wires touching), opens (broken wires), and crossed pairs (wires connected to wrong pins).

    "explanation": "A loopback plug (or loopback adapter) redirects the NIC's outgoing signal back to its own receive port, allowing the administrator to test the NIC's send and receive functionality in isolation. If the loopback test passes, the NIC is functioning properly and the problem is elsewhere. A cable tester checks cable integrity. A toner probe traces cables.
