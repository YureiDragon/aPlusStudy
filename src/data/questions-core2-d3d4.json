    "options": { "A": "Reinstall Windows 10", "B": "Replace the motherboard", "C": "Boot into Safe Mode and roll back or update the graphics driver", "D": "Run a full antivirus scan" },
    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "The DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL stop code typically indicates a driver issue. Since the BSOD started after installing a new graphics card, the most likely cause is a driver conflict. Booting into Safe Mode and rolling back or updating the driver is the correct first step. Reinstalling Windows is excessive, motherboard replacement is unrelated, and an antivirus scan would not address a driver issue.",

    "options": { "A": "Both issues are caused by RAM failure", "B": "Computer A likely has a corrupted or missing boot record/partition, while Computer B likely has a driver or system file issue that occurs after the boot loader has already started loading the OS", "C": "Computer A needs a new monitor, while Computer B needs a new keyboard", "D": "Computer A has a software issue, while Computer B has a hardware issue exclusively" },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "'No OS found' indicates the system cannot locate a bootable partition or the boot record is corrupted/missing, meaning the OS boot process never begins. A BSOD that occurs after the Windows logo appears means the boot loader successfully started but the OS encountered a critical error during loading, such as a corrupt driver or system file.

    "question": "What is the difference between a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) and a surge suppressor?",
    "options": { "A": "They are the same device with different names", "B": "A UPS provides battery backup power during outages and typically includes surge protection, while a surge suppressor only protects against voltage spikes and does not provide backup power", "C": "A surge suppressor provides backup power, while a UPS protects against surges", "D": "UPS devices are only used in homes, while surge suppressors are only used in offices" },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "A UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) contains batteries that provide temporary power during outages, allowing equipment to continue running or shut down gracefully, and most UPS units also include surge protection. A surge suppressor (or surge protector) only guards against voltage spikes by diverting excess voltage to ground but provides no power during an outage. Critical systems typically require a UPS, while less critical devices may use surge suppressors.",

    "question": "A server room has been experiencing intermittent hardware failures. The technician discovers that the room temperature is consistently above 85 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity is very low. What environmental factors are contributing to the failures?",
    "options": { "A": "The room is too quiet", "B": "Excessive heat is causing components to overheat and fail, while low humidity increases the risk of ESD damage to sensitive electronics", "C": "The server room lights are too bright", "D": "The servers are too close to windows" },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Server rooms should maintain temperatures between 64-75 degrees Fahrenheit (18-24 degrees Celsius) and humidity between 40-60%. Excessive heat causes components to overheat, throttle, and eventually fail. Low humidity increases the risk of electrostatic discharge, which can damage sensitive electronics.
