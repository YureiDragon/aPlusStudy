    "answer": "Multimode fiber has a larger core (50-62.5 microns), uses LED light, and supports shorter distances (up to ~2 km). It is less expensive and typically has an orange or aqua jacket.",
    "explanation": "Multimode is common for short-distance runs within buildings or data centers. It is cheaper than single-mode but cannot match single-mode's distance capability. Common fiber connectors include LC, SC, and ST.",

    "question": "What type of paper does a thermal printer use and what maintenance does it require?",
    "answer": "Thermal printers use special heat-sensitive paper that darkens when heated -- no ink, toner, or ribbons needed. Maintenance includes cleaning the heating element and feed rollers.",
    "explanation": "Thermal printers are used for receipts, shipping labels, and barcodes. Thermal prints fade over time with heat/light exposure. If output is blank, the paper may be loaded upside down (wrong side facing the heating element).",

    "explanation": "Impact printers are the only type that can print multipart/carbon copy forms because they physically strike the paper. They are still used for invoices and shipping manifests. They are loud and lower quality but serve this specific niche.",

    "answer": "A VM includes a full guest OS, is fully isolated from other VMs, and is managed by a hypervisor. It consumes more resources but provides complete OS-level isolation.",
    "explanation": "VMs are ideal when different OS types are needed (e.g., running Linux and Windows on the same host). Each VM acts as a completely independent computer. The tradeoff is heavier resource usage compared to containers.",

    "question": "What is a container and how does it differ from a VM?",
    "answer": "A container shares the host OS kernel and packages only the application and its dependencies. It starts faster and uses fewer resources than a VM but provides less isolation.",

    "answer": "A public cloud is shared infrastructure operated by a third party and available to anyone (multi-tenant). Examples: AWS, Azure, GCP. It is the most cost-effective but offers the least control.",
    "explanation": "Public cloud achieves economies of scale through multi-tenancy (many customers share the same physical hardware, logically separated). It is the default choice for most cloud workloads due to low cost and ease of use.",

    "answer": "A virus attaches to legitimate files and spreads when the infected file is executed. It requires user action (running the file) to propagate.",

    "explanation": "Common ports: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 25 (SMTP), 53 (DNS), 3389 (RDP). Minimize the attack surface by closing all ports except those explicitly needed.",

    "answer": "Risks include voiding the warranty, enabling installation of unvetted/malicious apps, exposing the device to malware, losing access to secure apps (banking), OTA updates may fail, and the device becomes a larger attack target.",
    "explanation": "Removing security layers makes the device vulnerable to malware that would normally be blocked. Banking and payment apps often refuse to run on rooted/jailbroken devices for this reason.",

    "answer": "A normal change requires the full change management process including risk assessment, planning, and change board (CAB) approval before implementation. Example: applying a server patch during a scheduled maintenance window.",

    "explanation": "Emergency changes still require documentation, even if done after the fact. The urgency justifies skipping the normal approval timeline, but accountability and records are still required.",

    "explanation": "During a change freeze, only emergency changes addressing critical issues are permitted. The exam may present a scenario where a technician wants to apply updates during a critical period -- the answer is to wait until the freeze ends.",

    "answer": "Always use encrypted connections, verify the identity of remote support personnel, end sessions when complete, and be cautious of unsolicited remote access requests, which are a common tech support scam tactic.",
    "explanation": "Scammers often cold-call users claiming to be from Microsoft or their ISP and ask to install remote access software. Legitimate support will never make unsolicited remote access requests.",

    "question": "What is AI bias and why is it a concern?",
    "answer": "AI bias occurs when an AI system reflects biases present in its training data, leading to skewed or unfair outputs. It is a concern because biased AI can produce discriminatory recommendations or inaccurate results.",
    "explanation": "Training data that underrepresents certain groups or overrepresents others causes the AI to learn those imbalances. IT professionals should be aware that AI output is only as fair as its training data.",

    "question": "What are AI hallucinations?",
    "answer": "AI hallucinations occur when an AI generates confident but false or fabricated information. This is especially dangerous in technical contexts where incorrect commands or advice could cause system damage.",
    "explanation": "Always verify AI-generated output, particularly for technical procedures, commands, and factual claims. AI performs pattern matching, not true comprehension, so it can produce plausible-sounding but wrong answers.",

    "question": "Why might AI provide outdated or inaccurate information?",
    "answer": "AI models may lack up-to-date data because they are trained on data up to a cutoff date. They also lack true understanding, using pattern matching rather than comprehension, which can produce inaccurate results on specialized topics.",
    "explanation": "AI should augment human judgment, not replace it. For current events, recent patches, or rapidly changing technologies, always verify AI output against authoritative and current sources.",

    "question": "What data security risks exist when using public AI tools?",
    "answer": "Entering sensitive, proprietary, or personal data into public AI tools risks data exposure because the data is processed on external servers and may be used for training. Organizations must have policies about what data can be shared with AI.",
    "explanation": "Confidential company data, customer PII, proprietary code, and trade secrets should never be entered into public AI tools. The exam tests awareness of this data security consideration.",

    "answer": "Policies should cover appropriate use (what AI can and cannot be used for), plagiarism and attribution of AI-generated content, source verification requirements, and which AI tools are approved for use.",
    "explanation": "Clear AI usage policies prevent data leaks, ensure accountability for AI-generated work, and maintain professional standards. The exam tests understanding of policy considerations around AI adoption.",

    "question": "What is the difference between private and public AI models for data security?",
    "answer": "Public AI models process data on external servers and may use input for training, creating exposure risks. Private AI models run within the organization's infrastructure, keeping data internal and under organizational control.",
    "explanation": "Sensitive data (trade secrets, PII, financial data) should only be processed by private/on-premises AI. Public AI is suitable for general, non-sensitive queries. Always follow organizational policy on which tool to use.",

    "question": "How can AI assist with IT infrastructure monitoring and maintenance?",
    "answer": "AI can perform predictive maintenance (anticipating hardware failures), automated malware detection and response, and system monitoring with anomaly detection to identify problems before they cause outages.",
    "explanation": "AI-driven monitoring can detect unusual patterns in system logs, network traffic, or hardware metrics that humans might miss. However, AI recommendations should always be verified before taking action in production.",
