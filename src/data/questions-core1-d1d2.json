      "D": "The new display panel is emitting electromagnetic interference affecting wireless signal"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Wi-Fi antenna wires typically run through the display bezel in laptops. When the display is replaced, these wires can be disconnected, pinched, or damaged, leading to significantly weaker signal. The wireless card itself is unlikely to be damaged if the display was the focus. BIOS updates and display interference are not related to Wi-Fi signal degradation after a display replacement.",

    "explanation": "Since external USB headsets work correctly, the sound card and audio drivers are functioning.

      "D": "It reduces power consumption more effectively than software-based camera controls"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "A physical privacy shutter provides a hardware-level guarantee that the camera lens is physically blocked, so no image can be captured regardless of software or malware activity. Software-based controls can potentially be bypassed by malware. The shutter does not improve image quality, does not specifically prevent driver manipulation, and power savings are negligible.",

    "explanation": "The technician should consult the service manual for proper antenna wire placement. The two antenna leads (often labeled MAIN and AUX) must be connected to the correct terminals for optimal wireless performance.
