    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "IPS (In-Plane Switching) panels offer the widest viewing angles among LCD types, typically 178 degrees both horizontally and vertically. TN (Twisted Nematic) panels have the narrowest viewing angles. VA (Vertical Alignment) panels have better viewing angles than TN but not as good as IPS.

    "correct": "A",
    "explanation": "An inverter in older LCD displays converts DC power to AC power to drive the CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp) backlight.

    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) displays can produce true blacks because each pixel emits its own light and can be completely turned off.

    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "A washed-out image when viewed from the side is characteristic of a TN panel, which has notoriously narrow viewing angles.

    "explanation": "Mini-LED backlighting uses thousands of smaller LEDs compared to traditional LED backlighting, enabling many more local dimming zones for better contrast and deeper blacks.

    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "A 144Hz refresh rate means the monitor refreshes (redraws) the entire image 144 times per second.

    "explanation": "The most likely cause is that the motherboard uses DDR5 slots, which have a different key notch position than DDR4.

    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Secured prints (also called pull printing or PIN printing) hold the print job on the printer until the user authenticates at the device using a PIN, badge, or other credential to release it. This prevents sensitive documents from sitting in the output tray for anyone to pick up. Duplex printing relates to double-sided output. Color restrictions limit color usage. Paper tray locking prevents tray access but not document security.",

Common causes include worn separation pads or rollers that fail to separate individual sheets, paper stuck together due to humidity or static (fan the paper before loading), or overfilled paper trays. Printer drivers, network speed, and toner levels do not cause physical paper feeding issues.",

The technician should restart the print spooler service (services.msc > Print Spooler > Restart), clear the pending jobs from the queue, and verify the connection between the computer and printer. Toner replacement, tray replacement, and OS reinstallation are unnecessary and would not resolve a spooler issue.",

    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Speckling (random scattered dots or spots) on laser prints is caused by loose toner particles on the drum or rollers, a defective or leaking toner cartridge, or a worn imaging drum that is not properly controlling toner distribution. Cleaning the printer interior and replacing the toner cartridge or drum typically resolves this. Paper size, driver versions, and queue fullness do not cause speckling.",
