    "question": "Explain RAID 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10 -- minimum drives and key characteristics.",
    "answer": "RAID 0: minimum 2 drives, striping, no redundancy, best performance. RAID 1: minimum 2 drives, mirroring, full redundancy, 50% capacity loss. RAID 5: minimum 3 drives, striping with parity, survives 1 drive failure. RAID 6: minimum 4 drives, striping with double parity, survives 2 drive failures. RAID 10: minimum 4 drives, mirrored stripes, combines RAID 1+0 performance and redundancy.",
    "explanation": "Exam tip: RAID 0 = speed but NO fault tolerance (not true redundancy). RAID 1 = mirror (exact copy). RAID 5 = most common enterprise (parity). RAID 10 = best performance + redundancy but costs more drives. If a question asks for fault tolerance, eliminate RAID 0.",

    "answer": "110-120V is the standard household voltage in North America. 220-240V is standard in most of Europe, Asia, and other regions. Many PSUs have a voltage selector switch or auto-switching capability. Using the wrong voltage can damage or destroy the power supply and connected components.",
    "explanation": "Exam tip: Modern PSUs often have auto-switching (100-240V). Older PSUs have a red voltage selector switch on the back -- setting this incorrectly is dangerous. If deploying equipment internationally, verify voltage compatibility. Data centers often use 220-240V for efficiency.",

    "question": "What is the difference between shared (multi-tenant) and dedicated resources in cloud computing?",
    "answer": "Shared (multi-tenant): multiple customers share the same physical hardware, logically separated. Lower cost, standard security. Dedicated: physical hardware is exclusively assigned to a single customer. Higher cost, enhanced security and performance isolation, required for some compliance requirements.",
    "explanation": "Exam tip: Multi-tenancy is the default in public cloud and is how providers achieve economies of scale. Dedicated resources may be required for regulatory compliance (HIPAA, PCI-DSS) or workloads that need guaranteed performance. Know that 'noisy neighbor' issues occur in shared environments.",

    "question": "What do POST beep codes indicate, and what does a single short beep typically mean?",
    "answer": "POST (Power-On Self-Test) beep codes are audio signals from the motherboard speaker that indicate hardware status during startup. A single short beep typically means the POST completed successfully with no errors. Multiple beeps or patterns indicate specific hardware failures (varies by BIOS manufacturer).",
    "explanation": "Exam tip: Different BIOS manufacturers (AMI, Award, Phoenix) use different beep code patterns. Common codes: continuous beeping = RAM issue, one long + two short = video card issue. No beep at all could mean a dead motherboard, missing speaker, or no power.",

    "explanation": "Exam tip: Never pull jammed paper backwards (against the paper path direction) as this can damage fuser or roller components. Frequent jams in the same location suggest a worn roller or separation pad in that area. Replace rollers as part of regular maintenance.",

    "question": "What is fileless malware and why is it difficult to detect?",
    "answer": "Fileless malware operates entirely in memory (RAM) without writing files to disk. It typically exploits legitimate system tools like PowerShell, WMI, or macros to execute malicious code, making it difficult for traditional file-based antivirus to detect.",
    "explanation": "Since fileless malware does not create files, signature-based antivirus misses it. Detection requires behavioral analysis, memory scanning, and monitoring of script execution. EDR solutions are more effective against fileless malware than traditional antivirus.",

    "question": "How should a technician handle confidential materials encountered during a service call?",
    "answer": "Never read, copy, or share confidential materials. Do not browse files beyond what is necessary for the repair. If you encounter sensitive data, do not mention it to others. Respect the user's privacy. If you need to access specific files for troubleshooting, ask the user's permission first.",
    "explanation": "Technicians often have elevated access to systems and may encounter financial records, medical data, personal photos, or corporate secrets. Professional ethics require treating all user data as confidential. The exam tests this concept in scenario-based questions about proper technician behavior.",

    "question": "What is the difference between a .bat file and a .ps1 file?",
    "answer": "A .bat file is a Windows batch script that runs in the Command Prompt (cmd.exe) using older DOS-style commands. A .ps1 file is a PowerShell script that runs in the PowerShell environment and has access to more powerful features including .NET framework, object-oriented pipeline, and advanced system management cmdlets.",
    "explanation": "PowerShell scripts (.ps1) are more capable than batch files but require the execution policy to be set appropriately (e.g., Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned). Batch files are simpler and backward-compatible. The exam may present a script file extension and ask which environment runs it.",

    "question": "What third-party remote access capabilities are commonly used in business environments?",
    "answer": "Common third-party remote access capabilities include: screen sharing (viewing/controlling another user's screen), video conferencing (virtual meetings), file transfer (sending files between local and remote systems), and desktop management tools (deploying software, running scripts, managing settings remotely).",
    "explanation": "Tools like TeamViewer, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and AnyDesk provide these capabilities. For security: always use encrypted connections, verify the identity of remote support personnel, end sessions when complete, and be cautious of unsolicited remote access requests (common tech support scam). The exam tests awareness of remote support tools and security.",

    "question": "How can AI be integrated into IT applications and workflows?",
    "answer": "AI can be integrated for: automated ticket categorization and routing, predictive maintenance (anticipating hardware failures), intelligent search and knowledge base suggestions, automated malware detection and response, chatbot-based first-tier support, and automated system monitoring with anomaly detection.",
    "explanation": "AI integration in IT is growing rapidly. The exam tests awareness of how AI assists IT operations rather than deep technical knowledge. Key point: AI augments human capabilities but requires oversight. Always verify AI recommendations before implementing changes in production environments.",
