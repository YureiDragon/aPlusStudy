      "A": "Password managers make passwords easier to share with coworkers by storing them in a shared accessible vault",
      "B": "Password managers generate and store unique, complex passwords for each account, eliminating password reuse",
      "C": "Password managers store passwords in plain text for easy access without any encryption or security measures",
      "D": "Password managers eliminate the need for any form of authentication by automatically logging users in"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Password managers securely generate, store, and auto-fill unique, complex passwords for each website and account. This eliminates the need to remember multiple passwords and prevents the common security risk of password reuse (using the same password across multiple sites). If one site is breached, only that unique password is compromised. Password managers encrypt their password vaults with a master password and often support multi-factor authentication for additional security.",

    "question": "A company wants to prevent employees from accessing social media and streaming sites during work hours through their web browsers. Which browser or network-level configuration would help?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Enable private browsing mode on all browsers to prevent employees from being tracked online",
      "B": "Configure a proxy server or secure DNS with content filtering to block specific website categories",
      "C": "Uninstall the web browser from all workstations to prevent any internet access during work hours",
      "D": "Change the desktop wallpaper to a reminder about company policy on acceptable internet usage"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "A proxy server or secure DNS with content filtering can block access to specific website categories (social media, streaming, gaming) across all browsers on the network. This can be configured at the browser level (proxy settings), at the network level (DNS-based filtering like OpenDNS), or through Group Policy in a domain environment. Private browsing only hides local history and does not prevent access. Removing browsers is impractical if web access is needed for work.",

    "question": "What is the purpose of clearing browsing data and cache in a web browser?",
    "options": {
      "A": "To increase the browser's maximum download speed by removing cached data that slows connection handling",
      "B": "To remove stored temporary files, cookies, cached pages, and browsing history that could contain sensitive information",
      "C": "To uninstall the browser completely from the system and remove all associated application data files",
      "D": "To update the browser to the latest version by clearing old files that prevent the update from installing"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Clearing browsing data removes temporary files, cookies (which may contain session data or tracking information), cached web pages, browsing history, saved form data, and download history. This is important for privacy (removing traces of browsing activity), security (clearing stored credentials and session cookies), and troubleshooting (resolving website display issues caused by corrupted or outdated cached content). It is especially important on shared or public computers.",

    "options": {
      "A": "They are identical in function; both block the same types of unwanted content in the browser",
      "B": "A pop-up blocker prevents new windows or tabs from opening automatically, while an ad blocker hides embedded advertisements",
      "C": "Ad blockers only work on mobile browsers, while pop-up blockers work exclusively on desktop browser platforms",
      "D": "Pop-up blockers remove all images from web pages, while ad blockers only block text-based advertisements"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Pop-up blockers prevent websites from automatically opening new browser windows or tabs (pop-ups), which are often used for advertising or malicious purposes. Most browsers include a built-in pop-up blocker. Ad blockers (typically browser extensions like uBlock Origin) go further by removing or hiding advertisements embedded within web pages, including banner ads, video ads, and tracking scripts. Both improve browsing security and experience, but ad blockers provide more comprehensive content filtering.",
